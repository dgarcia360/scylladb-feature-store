# What is a feature store?
Feature stores are central data stores to power operational machine learning models. They help you store transformed feature values in a scalable and performant database. Real-time inference requires features to be returned to applications with low latency at scale. This is where ScyllaDB can play a crucial role in your machine learning infrastructure.

## How can ScyllaDB help you build a feature store?
ScyllaDB is a real-time high-throughput NoSQL database that is best suited for feature stores where you require low latency consistently, and need peta-byte scalability.

* **Low-latency**: ScyllaDB can provide <10 ms P99 latency. Low latency can speed up training time and leads to faster model development.
* **High-throughput**: Training requires huge amounts of data and processing large datasets with many millions of operations per second - something that ScyllaDB excels at.
* **Large-scale**: ScyllaDB can handle petabytes of data while still providing great performance.
